## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

The power of flexbox really makes this project interesting as well as the linear gradient overlay on the background picture of the card

```html
<div class="header-img"> </div>
```
```css
.header-img {
  background:linear-gradient(to right, hsl(277, 64%, 61%, 0.6), hsl(277, 64%, 61%, 0.6)), url(../images/image-header-desktop.jpg);
  width: 50%;
  background-size: auto auto;
  border-top-right-radius: 10px;
  border-bottom-right-radius: 10px;
}
```

### Continued development

I'll like to learn and be more proficient with CSS grid
